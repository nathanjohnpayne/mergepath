# Agent Operating Rules

Read in this order before taking any action:

1. `README.md` — understand the project
2. `AGENTS.md` — load behavioral instructions (index pointing to this directory)
3. `rules/repo_rules.md` — load binding constraints
4. Relevant `specs/` files — understand intended behavior
5. `.ai_context.md` — load supplemental context

Conflict resolution:

- If code conflicts with `specs/`: flag the conflict, update spec or
  tests first, then update code. Do not silently modify behavior.
- If a proposed change violates `rules/repo_rules.md`: stop and flag
  the violation. Do not proceed without resolution.
- If a tool folder contains instructions that conflict with `AGENTS.md`
  or these sub-files: follow the canonical docs and flag the duplication
  for removal.
- If `AGENTS.md` or its sub-files are missing required sections: flag
  the gap and do not assume behavior for missing sections.

## 1Password CLI authentication failures

If any `op` command (`op read`, `op inject`, `op run`, `op document get`,
or any script that wraps them) fails with a sign-in or authentication
error — including but not limited to:

- `[ERROR] ... not currently signed in`
- `session expired`
- `biometric unlock ... timed out`
- `authorization prompt dismissed`
- `error initializing client: authorization`

Then follow this procedure:

1. **Stop immediately.** Do not retry the command, do not attempt
   workarounds (manual token entry, environment variable overrides,
   fallback credential paths, or skipping the credential step).
2. **Prompt the human with context.** State what you were trying to do
   and what credential you needed. Example:
   > "1Password is timing out. Could you let me know when you are back
   > to provide a biometric response? I need the reviewer PAT to
   > approve PR #142."
3. **Wait for the human to confirm** they are present and ready before
   retrying the `op` command.
4. After confirmation, retry **once**. If it fails again, report the
   full error output and wait — do not loop.

This rule applies only to 1Password CLI sign-in and authentication
errors. Other `op` failures (wrong item ID, missing field, network
errors, vault permission errors) should be diagnosed and resolved
normally.
