#
# The `label-gate` job in .github/workflows/pr-review-policy.yml used to decide
# from context.payload.pull_request.labels — the event's snapshot. A re-run
# replays the ORIGINAL payload, so a run that failed on a since-removed
# blocking label failed identically on every re-run (seen on #1318). The job
# now reads the PR's live labels and fails closed when it cannot.
#
# The script under test is the REAL github-script body, extracted from the
# workflow with yq and executed under node with mocked github/context/core, so
# the test cannot drift from what CI runs.
