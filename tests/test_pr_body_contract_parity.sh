# read `Authoring-Agent:` through the SAME parser (#1121).
#
# The defect this guards against is not a parse bug in any one consumer; each
# local regex was individually reasonable. It is DIVERGENCE: gh-pr-guard.sh
# ignored a marker inside an HTML comment while agent-review.yml,
# codex-review-check.sh and phase-4b-review.sh each took the first RAW line. On
# a body carrying a commented-out marker before a visible one they disagree, so
# the same PR can be assigned to one reviewer, attributed to another by the
# guard, and evaluated by merge-clearance as if the same-agent Codex-reaction
# fallback were eligible. Parity is the property under test.
